# __Upcoming release__

# Release 1.15.0+dc.11

- Memoize `Scope.get_region()` like `get_end()` and `get_logical_end()`, so
  offset lookups stop re-scanning decorator tokens for every subscope. Scopes
  are rebuilt with their module, so a changed source never sees a stale region.

# Release 1.15.0+dc.10

- Tokenize a module once however many names are searched in it, caching the
  name index by source text.

# Release 1.15.0+dc.9

- Memoize offset resolution on each module until the project data changes,
  so repeated occurrence searches no longer re-resolve the same offset. Any
  change to a loaded resource retires every memo.

# Release 1.15.0+dc.8

- Type `rope.base.utils.saveit` so decorated methods and properties, such
  as `Project.pycore`, keep their return type for type checkers.
- Keep analysing classes whose hierarchy Python refuses to create, as upstream
  does: their attributes, `super()`, `type()` and type hints follow the
  declared bases. Only `AbstractClass.get_mro()` raises
  `InconsistentHierarchyError`; the new `get_consistent_mro()` returns `None`
  for such classes instead.
- Restore `rope.base.oi.type_hinting.utils.get_mro()`.
- Infer `super()` along the method resolution order and bind the real
  receiver of calls made through it.
- Restore the upstream source form of lines that a linter had rewritten
  without changing behavior, and keep comments in English.
- Infer assignments without source-index provenance, such as those of an
  independently parsed expression, as unconditional assignments again.
- Store literal values in the object database the way their builtin base
  class is stored, by resolving textual transformations along the MRO.
- Keep static object information for names read through a branch context that
  does not select any of their assignments, and for value overlays of a
  source name.
- Classify evaluated bases by the native `AbstractClass` contract rather than
  equality with metatype markers. An unresolved base must retain its source
  witness without being treated as a class supporting method resolution order.

# Release 1.15.0+dc.7

- Resolve class attributes in C3 method resolution order instead of a
  depth-first walk of the bases, so diamond hierarchies inherit the member
  Python's `__mro__` selects. `AbstractClass.get_mro()` exposes that order.
- Model builtin classes with their runtime bases and `__mro__`, so `object`
  sorts last and a builtin ancestor contributes only the attributes it
  defines itself.
- Select inherited docstring and assignment type hints along the same
  method resolution order instead of a breadth-first walk.
- Keep bases rope cannot evaluate to a class as `UnresolvedBase` markers in
  `AbstractClass.get_bases()` and in the method resolution order instead of
  dropping them; `get_superclasses()` still returns only the classes.
- Raise `InconsistentHierarchyError` for cyclic, repeated, and unmergeable
  bases, which Python refuses to create.

# Release 1.15.0+dc.6

- Classify evaluated bases by the native `AbstractClass` contract rather than
  equality with metatype markers. An unresolved base must retain its source
  witness without being treated as a class supporting method resolution order.

- Infer `super(cls, obj)` along the method resolution order of `cls` past
  `cls` itself instead of as an instance of its first base. Methods and
  classmethods called through it bind the real receiver.

# Release 1.15.0+dc.7

- Resolve class attributes in C3 method resolution order instead of a
  depth-first walk of the bases, so diamond hierarchies inherit the member
  Python's `__mro__` selects. `AbstractClass.get_mro()` exposes that order.
- Model builtin classes with their runtime bases and `__mro__`, so `object`
  sorts last and a builtin ancestor contributes only the attributes it
  defines itself.
- Select inherited docstring and assignment type hints along the same
  method resolution order instead of a breadth-first walk.
- Keep bases rope cannot evaluate to a class as `UnresolvedBase` markers in
  `AbstractClass.get_bases()` and in the method resolution order instead of
  dropping them; `get_superclasses()` still returns only the classes.
- Raise `InconsistentHierarchyError` for cyclic, repeated, and unmergeable
  bases, which Python refuses to create.

# Release 1.15.0+dc.6

- Resolve class-owned PEP 695 aliases from other lazy aliases in the same class,
  including forward declarations and names shadowing module aliases. Conditional
  declarations retain their ambiguous source identity.
- Resolve opaque annotation references through their captured source contexts
  when refactoring checks request them, avoiding duplicate binding resolution
  while constructing the source index.
- Add `match_filter` and `import_filter` to `Restructure`: callables consulted
  for every match found in a module and for the imports added to a changed
  module, so clients select both without overriding private methods.

# Release 1.15.0+dc.5

- Record PEP 695 type-alias declaration locations in module, function, and class
  scopes without evaluating or substituting the lazy alias value.
- Preserve first-binding locations across ordinary assignments, repeated aliases,
  imports, and native renames; verify these contracts against the installed wheel.
- Keep constructor and method aliases local to their declaration scope, without
  polluting instance attributes collected by the target-only visitor.
- Select native setup interpreters independently of ancestor project constraints.

# Release 1.15.0+dc.4

- Patch expressions in the `else` suite before `finally` for both `try` and
  `try`/`except*`, preserving source regions and semantic matching.
- Verify source round-tripping and parenthesized attribute matching against the
  installed wheel as well as the source checkout.
- Initialize the documented source-folder configuration without invoking a
  deprecated private helper, preserving explicit folder selection without warnings.
- Preserve f-string references across supported Python tokenizers and expression
  coordinates for escaped braces and Unicode, adopting the reviewed native fixes.
- Keep autoimport project-relative paths and nested installation roots separate on
  Windows, and scope the metadata task check to its required checks permission.
- Validate published downstream GitHub Release assets through the native installed
  wheel contract, without sending local-version builds to the upstream PyPI publisher.
- Isolate installed-wheel pytest configuration from ancestor projects and inherited
  pytest options while retaining the native test configuration and contracts.

# Release 1.15.0+dc.3

Flext-ecosystem compatibility and robustness over 1.15.0+dc.2:

- Expose a module scope over builtin modules (`BuiltinModule.get_scope` + `BuiltinModuleScope`), so semantic-module consumers recognize C/builtin modules
- Do not require callers to preseed `ignored_resources` when a python path folder inside the root contains site-packages (#756 follow-up); both behaviors carry regression tests

# Release 1.15.0+dc.2

Performance and inference cycle on the 1.15.0+dc.1 line:

- Fix property inference regression from the parameter-bindings adoption: record function calls without resolving the function from its own text, restoring typed attributes on properties (rename no longer misses subclass call sites)
- Resolve external class-data plans once per module entry: single shared plan store, per-owner lazy resolution, attribute readers grouped in one pass, class-binding scan memoized
- Cut the source-binding index build cost (typed node dispatch, slotted contexts, ASCII fast paths in ASTLinesAdapter)
- Skip the opaque-reference scan for modules that never spell the renamed name and modules without class-attribute writes

# Release 1.15.0+dc.1
